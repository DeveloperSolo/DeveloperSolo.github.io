            Hi, I’m Solomon, a UI Gameplay Programming Intern currently working on Ubisoft Singapore’s Skull & Bones. I have spent the past 8+ years studying game design and development, where I was able to earn various awards for my efforts, like the Lee Kuan Yew Award for Mathematics and Science. I also have almost 2 years of professional experience developing games. This includes shipping 2 game titles, an indie game as part of a relatively small team, and a triple-A game as part of a large, multinational corporation. In my free time, I enjoy participating in game jams, like Ludum Dare and the GMTK game jam, and my love of playing games remain strong.

            <br><br>Games have helped me a lot in my life, from providing me with enjoyment and a sense of community, to imparting valuable lessons and even helping me with my studies. I believe that games have the potential to do a lot of good, and I aim to contribute to that effort, to create games that can help others as they have helped me. Programming has also become a fun and rewarding skill for me to hone, and I aim to continue growing this skill so that I can better design, implement and iterate on systems to solve problems more effectively.
            
            <br><br>If I sound like a good fit for your team, please contact me. I would love to have a chat on how we can potentially work together.
