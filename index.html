        <p>Growing up, some of my most fond memories were of playing made-up roleplaying games with my classmates any chance we could get. While one of us acts as the "game master", crafting whole worlds, storylines, and game systems for our friends to enjoy, the rest acts as players, throwing out any actions we wanted and seeing how the "game master" will resolve them. Realizing that I always enjoyed being the "game master" more than a player, that was when my love for game design was awakened.</p>
        <p>Since then, I have made great strides towards improving my game design and development skills. Through my efforts both in school and in my own time, I have honed my skills in Unity, C#, and C++. It was enough to even earn some awards, like the Lee Kuan Yew Award for Mathematics and Science, and the TP-MICROSOFT Skills Mastery Award.</p>
        <p>I was also fortunate enough to work at Daylight Studios, where I had the opportunity to work directly on two commercial titles, "Holy Potatoes! What the Hell?!" and "Holy Potatoes! A Spy Story?!". Being my first real step into the games industry, it was definitely an eye opening experience, and helped me cover some gaps that my academic teachings couldn't, like managing a more long-term development cycle, and how to balance and polish games with longer play times.</p>
        <p>Currently a student at DigiPen, I am grateful to have met and worked with similarly passionate individuals that have brought me to new heights of game development. Requiring us to develop our own custom game engine, I often take on a more multifaceted role and also work concurrently on gameplay. This also allows me to working closely from the start with not only the other programmers, but with the designers and artists as well.</p>
        <p>I aim to continue working in the games industry and bring my game design and development skills to new heights!</p>
